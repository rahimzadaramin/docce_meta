In view of extensive use of MATLAB for rapid verification of controller designs; some notes for using MATLAB script M-files and function M-files are included at the end of the book.","pdf.docinfo.modified":"2008-12-12T00:13:53","pdf.docinfo.producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0 (Windows)","pdf.docinfo.subject":"Electrical, Electronics, Computer, Information Technology, Telecommunication","pdf.encrypted":"false","pdf.hasmarkedcontent":"true","pdf.hasxfa":"false","pdf.hasxmp":"true","pdf.producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0 (Windows)","pdf.unmappedunicodecharsperpage":["0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","87","99","48","92","95","24","39","37","139","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","2","0","0","0","0","9","3","4","13","7","20","24","6","16","18","1","50","12","3","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","47","24","52","18","84","74","38","30","0","4","16","5","6","0","0","0","10","13","7","132","1","3","16","48","32","38","49","18","17","98","0","43","11","91","84","90","74","26","2","26","0","0","0","0","0","39","0","29","19","6","16","6","4","0","0","0","0","0","2","2","0","8","1","0","0","0","1","3","0","18","24","56","2","0","0","0","0","1","51","0","1","0","0","6","5","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","14","0","24","0","0","2","21","28","30","16","25","15","5","0","1","2","9","32","0","0","0","0","0","8","4","0","3","0","6","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","2","0","0","0","2","0","33","12","36","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","4","0","0","0","0","5","15","2","12","0","10","0","13","2","0","0","12","0","8","0","0","0","4","6","4","0","9","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","6","12","0","0","0","27","0","24","0","6","30","6","12","0","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","15","9","55","31","1","6","28","15","117","5","22","68","87","41","22","1","0","0","38","13","5","0","0","0","3","54","36","0","10","0","14","34","1","0","0","16","28","10","30","25","35","23","4","10","0","38","0","0","42","36","3","37","93","0","8","94","26","12","0","21","0","0","6","29","36","0","0","32","60","0","102","58","36","0","12","25","2","2","0","14","1","1","4","5","2","7","16","1","4","15","69","10","42","32","17","88","90","3","10","3","19","15","21","10","5","1","24","15","6","0","78","54","2","6","73","137","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","5","0","2","5","2","1","0","0","0","4","0","25","27","0","0","10","0","6","0","0","0","18","1","0","6","0","0","0","0","0","0","8","8","25","1","0","0","12","0","30","18","0","2","0","0","3","3","0","0","7","7","2","3","0","112","0","2","6","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","2","35","0","0","8","7","3","4","4","8","2","29","53","18","8","25","3","33","9","0","0","0","0","0","6","0","0","4","6","4","0","0","0","20","0","0","9","0","0","0","0","0","14","0","78","76","0","109","87","131","0","0","4","0","0","9","0","2","0","48","22","16","0","30","0","0","0","0","10","0","0","0","2","0","2","1","106","0","1","1","3","1","4","88","5","9","5","2","8","2","31","17","2","5","3","0","0","5","0","0","2","6","3","1","0","8","0","0","0","0","27","15","0","1","0","0","32","7","20","71","120","28","0","4","0","4","0","8","61","0","10","14","29","3","10","0","4","7","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"],"producer":"Acrobat Distiller 5.0 (Windows)","subject":"Electrical, Electronics, Computer, Information Technology, Telecommunication","xmp.createdate":"2007-06-07T12:46:48","xmp.creatortool":"PageMaker 5.0","xmp.metadatadate":"2008-12-11T19:13:53","xmp.modifydate":"2008-12-11T19:13:53","xmpmm.documentid":"uuid:5335d103-865e-41fe-bba2-fbb6acac8f86"},"sha256":"D00BCC09618A138B16CE29CD9542C99D9E0F11F17929614F400F8DE25A4FE686","clean.language":"en","clean.title":"introduction to control engineering - modeling, analysis and design","clean.pageCount":"633","clean.author":"a.k. mandal","clean.creator":"a.k. mandal"}
