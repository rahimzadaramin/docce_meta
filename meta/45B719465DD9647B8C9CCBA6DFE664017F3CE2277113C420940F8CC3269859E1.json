By the end of the summer, when <em>Tin House</em> published \"Memory,\" Stephen had completed a draft of <em>Duma Key</em>, and it became clear to me how \"Memory\" and its narrator, Edgar Freemantle, had moved from Minnesota to Florida, and how a story of divorce had turned into something more complex, more strange, and much more terrifying.</p><p>If you read the following two texts side by side--\"Memory\" as it was published by <em>Tin House</em> and the opening chapter of <em>Duma Key</em> in final form--you'll see a writer at work, and how stories can both contract and expand.

Suffice it to say that <em>Duma Key</em>, the story of Edgar Freemantle and his recovery from the terrible nightmare-inducing accident that stole his arm and ended his marriage, is Stephen King's most brilliant novel to date (outside of the <em>Dark Tower</em> novels, in which case <em>each</em> is arguably his best work). <em>Duma Key</em> is as rich and rewarding as <em>Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption</em> (yes, <em>that</em> <em>Shawshank Redemption</em>), and as truly scary as anything King has written (and that's saying a lot). Readers who have \"always wanted to try Stephen King\" but never known where to start should try a few pages of <em>Duma Key</em>--the frankness with which Edgar reveals his desperate, sputtering rages and thoughts of suicide is King at the top of his game. And that's just the first thirty pages... <em>--Daphne Durham</em></p><hr /><p><strong><em>Duma Key</em>: Where It All Began</strong><br /><strong>A Note from Chuck Verrill, the Longtime Editor of Stephen King</strong><br />In the spring of 2006 Stephen King told me he was working on a Florida story that was beginning to grow on him. \"I'm thinking of calling it <em>Duma Key</em>,\" he offered. I liked the sound of that--the title was like a drumbeat of dread. \"You know how <em>Lisey's Story</em> is a story about marriage?\" he said. \"Sure,\" I answered. The novel hadn't yet been published, but I knew its story well: Lisey and Scott Landon--what a marriage that was. Then he dropped the other shoe: \"I think <em>Duma Key</em> might be my story of divorce.\"</p><p>Pretty soon I received a slim package from a familiar address in Maine. Inside was a short story titled \"Memory\"--a story of divorce, all right, but set in Minnesota. By the end of the summer, when <em>Tin House</em> published \"Memory,\" Stephen had completed a draft of <em>Duma Key</em>, and it became clear to me how \"Memory\" and its narrator, Edgar Freemantle, had moved from Minnesota to Florida, and how a story of divorce had turned into something more complex, more strange, and much more terrifying.</p><p>If you read the following two texts side by side--\"Memory\" as it was published by <em>Tin House</em> and the opening chapter of <em>Duma Key</em> in final form--you'll see a writer at work, and how stories can both contract and expand. Whether <em>Duma Key</em> is an expansion of \"Memory\" or \"Memory\" a contraction of <em>Duma Key</em>, I can't really say. Can you?</p><p><em>--Chuck Verrill</em></p><p><strong>\"Memory\"</strong><br />Memories are contrary things; if you quit chasing them and turn your back, they often return on their own. That's what Kamen says. I tell him I never chased the memory of my accident. Some things, I say, are better forgotten. </p><p>Maybe, but that doesn’t matter, either. That's what Kamen says.</p><p>My name is Edgar Freemantle. I used to be a big deal in building and construction. This was in Minnesota, in my other life. I was a genuine American-boy success in that life, worked my way up like a motherf---er, and for me, everything worked out. When Minneapolis–St. Paul boomed, The Freemantle Company boomed. When things tightened up, I never tried to force things. But I played my hunches, and most of them played out well. By the time I was fifty, Pam and I were worth about forty million dollars. And what we had together still worked. I looked at other women from time to time but never strayed. At the end of our particular Golden Age, one of our girls was at Brown and the other was teaching in a foreign exchange program. Just before things went wrong, my wife and I were planning to go and visit her.</p><p>I had an accident at a job site. That's what happened. I was in my pickup truck. The right side of my skull was crushed. My ribs were broken. My right hip was shattered. And although I retained sixty percent of the sight in my right eye (more, on a good day), I lost almost all of my right arm.</p><p>I was supposed to lose my life, but I didn’t. Then I was supposed to become one of the Vegetable Simpsons, a Coma Homer, but that didn't happen, either. I was one confused American when I came around, but the worst of that passed. By the time it did, my wife had passed, too. She's remarried to a fellow who owns bowling alleys. My older daughter likes him. My younger daughter thinks he’s a yank-off. My wife says she’ll come around.</p><p>Maybe <em>sí</em>, maybe <em>no</em>. That's what Kamen says.</p><p>When I say I was confused, I mean that at first I didn’t know who people were, or what had happened, or why I was in such awful pain. I can't remember the quality and pitch of that pain now. I know it was excruciating, but it's all pretty academic. Like a picture of a mountain in <em>National Geographic</em> magazine. It wasn’t academic at the time. At the time it was more like climbing a mountain.</p><p>Continue Reading \"Memory\"</p><p><strong><em>Duma Key</em></strong><br /><strong>How to Draw a Picture</strong><br /><em>Start with a blank surface. It doesn't have to be paper or canvas, but I feel it should be white. We call it white because we need a word, but its true name is nothing. Black is the absence of light, but white is the absence of memory, the color of can't remember.</em></p><p><em>How do we remember to remember? That's a question I've asked myself often since my time on Duma Key, often in the small hours of the morning, looking up into the absence of light, remembering absent friends. Sometimes in those little hours I think about the horizon. You have to establish the horizon. You have to mark the white. A simple enough act, you might say, but any act that re-makes the world is heroic. Or so I’ve come to believe.</em></p><p><em>Imagine a little girl, hardly more than a baby. She fell from a carriage almost ninety years ago, struck her head on a stone, and forgot everything. Not just her name; everything! And then one day she recalled just enough to pick up a pencil and make that first hesitant mark across the white. A horizon-line, sure. But also a slot for blackness to pour through.</em></p><p><em>Still, imagine that small hand lifting the pencil... hesitating... and then marking the white. Imagine the courage of that first effort to re-establish the world by picturing it. I will always love that little girl, in spite of all she has cost me. I must. I have no choice. Pictures are magic, as you know.</em></p><p><strong>My Other Life</strong><br />My name is Edgar Freemantle. I used to be a big deal in the building and contracting business. This was in Minnesota, in my other life. I learned that my-other-life thing from Wireman. I want to tell you about Wireman, but first let's get through the Minnesota part.</p><p>Gotta say it: I was a genuine American-boy success there. Worked my way up in the company where I started, and when I couldn’t work my way any higher there, I went out and started my own. The boss of the company I left laughed at me, said I'd be broke in a year. I think that's what most bosses say when some hot young pocket-rocket goes off on his own.</p><p>For me, everything worked out. When Minneapolis–St. Paul boomed, The Freemantle Company boomed. When things tightened up, I never tried to play big. But I did play my hunches, and most played out well. By the time I was fifty, Pam and I were worth forty million dollars. And we were still tight. We had two girls, and at the end of our particular Golden Age, Ilse was at Brown and Melinda was teaching in France, as part of a foreign exchange program. At the time things went wrong, my wife and I were planning to go and visit her.</p><p>Continue Reading <em>Duma Key</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. King's latest novel is a fantastically eerie tale in line with his best psychological thrillers. John Slattery offers a triumphal performance—his firm, gripping tone perfectly suits this story of the darker side of human memory and creativity. The characters are each so different and complicated, creating a challenge for even the most seasoned narrator. But Slattery does the near-impossible and physically becomes Edgar Freemantle. In fact, the two become so inseparable the listener almost feels guilty listening to his heartfelt confessions. King's vision of Freemantle's fictional personal memoir demands a narrator so believable and solid in his delivery that it seems almost impossible. But Slattery creates a truly moving experience, commanding and truthful. <br />Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
