Cam's got big plans for Crane Enterprises. To break into the California surfing market he hires marketing genius Jennifer Talbot from San Francisco, a cool blonde who's brilliant at what she does.

Even if she didn't have a rule about getting involve with clients, she has a man waiting for her at home who is respectable, compatible, perfect for her in every way.
