A female sheriff in a flooded town attempts to cover up a murder. When a farmer harvesting a field accidentally runs over his son, his grief sets him off walking, mile after mile. A band of teens bent on destruction runs amok in a deserted town at night. As these men and women lash out at the inscrutable churn of the world around them, they find a grim measure of peace in their solitude.   </p><p>Throughout <em>Volt</em>, Alan Heathcock’s stark realism is leavened by a lyric energy that matches the brutality of the surface. And as you move through the wind-lashed landscape of these stories, faint signs of hope appear underfoot. In <em>Volt</em>, the work of a writer who’s hell-bent on wrenching out whatever beauty this savage world has to offer, Heathcock’s tales of lives set afire light up the sky like signal flares touched off in a moment of desperation.</p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. Heathcock's impressive debut collection pursues modern American prairie characters through some serious Old Testament muck. If it's not flood or fire ravishing the village of Krafton, then it's fratricide, pedocide, or just plain ol' stranger killing. In the National Magazine Award–winning \"Peacekeeper,\" middle-aged grocery store manager Helen Farraley becomes the town's first sheriff and cuts her teeth on a missing-child case. When snow tracks lead her to discover the girl's grim fate, Helen skirts the law so that \"the unrighteous cause of her death kept a gracious unknown.\" In \"Smoke,\" the sins of the father visit 15-year-old Vernon when his war vet father drags him out of bed to cremate the man he's killed. In the suspenseful \"The Daughter,\" we watch the sins drip down the maternal line, as well. Misery is in plentiful supply throughout these dark, thickly atmospheric tales of spiritual desolation and savagery. Fans of William Gay and Daniel Woodrell will savor these stories where sin and suffering shroud the hope of redemption. (Mar.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC. All rights reserved. </p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>In these eight stories, four previously published in literary journals, the settings are small towns in the mountains and valleys of the northern plains states. No peaceful rural areas exist in Heathcock's imagination. There's a violent death, whether accidental or planned, in every story. The last six stories constitute a terrific cycle, set in the same town, with the repeating characters of sheriff, mayor, and minister and plots that provide climaxes and resolutions that suit the cycle. It is carefully structured and introduces the town and recurrent characters in the first story, Peacemaker, and then includes them in the ensuing events that trouble the community and disturb the equilibrium of the townspeople. But what really distinguishes the collection is the lyricism of the prose. Heathcock displays a real talent for describing a character in a telling phrase and shows a deep appreciation of the petty and serious violence of daily life. Recommend Volt to fans of Cormac McCarthy, Larry Brown, and Tom Franklin. --Ellen Loughran </p></div>","dc.identifier":"4f8217dc-9ab2-4504-bc0d-2b677f5191fa","dc.publisher":"Macmillan","dc.subject":["Fiction","Literary"],"dcterms.created":"2011-03-01T09:00:00+04:00","description":"<div><p><strong>A blistering collection of stories from an exhilarating new voice</strong></p><p>One man kills another after neither will move his pickup truck from the road.
