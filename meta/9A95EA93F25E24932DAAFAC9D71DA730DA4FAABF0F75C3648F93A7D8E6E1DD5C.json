A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission,  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don’t expect any spoilers in this review. It’s much more fun not knowing what’s coming—and in the case of Rowling’s delicious sixth book, you don’t want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won’t stop until you reach the very last page.   A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre,  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J. K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  and  Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way.</p>","dc.identifier":"46cc43b5-7f90-4af3-804c-6d5095286b11","dcterms.created":"0101-01-01T04:00:00+04:00","description":"<p class=\"description\">The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped  Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, “Is it worth the hype?” The answer, luckily, is simple: yep.
