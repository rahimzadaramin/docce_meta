In fact, his favorite dream is of a world far away, a world where magic is as common as air, where animals tell jokes, and where trees beg people to pick their fruit. He even has a name for this place ¬Farworld. When Marcus magically travels to Farworld, he meets Kyja, a girl without magic in a world where spells, charms, and potions are everywhere, and Master Therapass, a master wizard who has kept a secret hidden for thirteen years, a secret that could change the fate of two ¬worlds. But the Dark Circle has learned of Master Therapass s secret and their evil influence and power are growing. Farworld s only hope is for Marcus and Kyja to find the mythical ¬Elementals ¬water, land, air, and -fire ¬and convince them to open a drift between the ¬worlds. As Kyja and Marcus travel to Water Keep, they must face the worst the evil Dark Circle can throw at them ¬Summoners, who can command the living and the dead; Unmakers, invisible creatures that can destroy both body and soul; and dark mages known as Thrathkin S Bae. Along the way, Marcus and Kyja will discover the truth about their own heritage, the strength of their friendship, and the depths of their unique ¬powers.</p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>Marcus, a wheelchair-bound 13-year-old, is bullied at his Arizona boarding school. He dreams about an alternate universe, Far World, and his dreams blur into reality after a Far World girl, Kyra, pulls him into her realm. Kyra has a handicap of her own: unlike everyone else in her magic world, she has no magical powers of her own. The two young people seem fated to join forces, and together, they embark on a quest to save Far World from evil. Much of the writing is clichéd, but the sophomoric humor will entertain younger readers, and the characters are intriguing enough to hold up a story that owes much to the Harry Potter series, from the child scarred as an infant after a potentially fatal attack to otherworldly villains who suck people’s emotions to the kindly old wizard mentor.
