I defy you to start it and find a way to put it down ...This is an amazing work of popular fiction' STEPHEN KING 'I don't know how Iles did it, but every single one of the 700+ pages of NATCHEZ BURNING is a cliffhanger that will keep you devouring just one more chapter before you put it down to eat, work, or go to bed. A mystery rooted in the real-life racial divides of the Deep South, this ambitious, unique novel is the perfect marriage of a history lesson and a thriller. Greg? You owe me some sleep!' JODI PICOULT 'Natchez Burning is just flat-out terrific, written with all the fire of its title. With its scope and passion and its themes about race, violence, tradition, and the eternal smouldering anger of the South, it brings to mind Thomas Wolfe and William Faulkner, even while its cagey plot and restless energy keeps you flying through the pages. Greg Iles is back and truly better than ever' SCOTT TUROW Praise for previous Greg Iles novels: 'A scorching read' John Grisham 'A rarity. A thriller that really thrills' Stephen King 'An incredible web of intrigue and suspense' Clive Cussler 'My favourite kind of novel ...
