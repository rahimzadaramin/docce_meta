Yet, God is unconditional love, and Christ came to set us free, so logically and realistically, how can we be set free if we are plagued mentally with the idea of eternal conscious torment in a place called Hell? God tells us through the Scripture's that He has no conditions on His love for all humanity, yet at the same time, the church tells us that we need to 'do' certain things or else pay the Hellfire price. Fear can not reside in love, so how can such a fear dominated place called Hell ever exist in God as the church over the years has portrayed? In this book, Don Keathley, who is a magnificent grace teacher with over 40 years of pastoral experience and a PhD degree, will expose the lies about Hell, which has been taught  to us by the church. He has investigated all the words that Jesus spoke where He used the word Hell and present's to you all the correct original Greek meanings, context, and references for each time the word Hell is mentioned in the Old Testament and the New Testament. Once you understand what the correct meaning is, then the understanding about Hell that you hold will disappear into the illusion that it really is, and as God's truth can only do, it will set you free. God is love and in Him resides no fear and no evil. You and your loved ones only have one eternal destination.</p><p> </p>","dc.identifier":"B08DF828H2","dc.publisher":"Don Keathley","dcterms.created":"2020-07-21","description":"<p>Hell, is a place that is depicted as eternal conscious torment for all people, other than those who have done specific requirements to escape this eternal, blazing inferno.
