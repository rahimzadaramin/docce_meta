Reflecting on his coming-of-age in the South as a Boy Scout and a lover of ants and butterflies, Wilson threads these twenty-one letters, each richly illustrated, with autobiographical anecdotes that illuminate his career—both his successes and his failures—and his motivations for becoming a biologist. At a time in human history when our survival is more than ever linked to our understanding of science, Wilson insists that success in the sciences does not depend on mathematical skill, but rather a passion for finding a problem and solving it.

Wilson, the evolutionary biologist who has studied social behavior among insects and humans, offers advice to aspiring researchers…A naturalist at heart, he plays down technology, math, even intelligence, proposing that a good scientist should be ‘bright enough to see what can be done but not too bright as to become bored doing it.’…delivers deep insights into how observation and experiment drive theory.” (<strong>Jascha Hoffman - *New York Times</strong>* )<br></p><p>“The eminent entomologist, naturalist and sociobiologist draws on the experiences of a long career to offer encouraging advice to those considering a life in science… Glows with one man’s love for science.” (<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong> )<br></p><p>“In this fund of practical and philosophical guidance distilled from seven decades of experience, Wilson provides exactly the right mentoring for scientists of all disciplines—and all ages… This is no pompous, deeply philosophical treatise on how great ideas develop. Wilson shares his simple love for ants and their natural history, revelling in them without hesitation. Everything else follows.” (<strong><em>Nature</em></strong> )<br></p><p>“Beautifully written, richly detailed, and practical, [Wilson's] little book should command the attention of anyone who is contemplating a career in ecology or biodiversity—or who 'sometimes daydreams like a scientist.' Along with intellectually curious people everywhere, they will enjoy and profit from <em>Letters to a Young Scientist</em>.” (<strong>Glenn C.
