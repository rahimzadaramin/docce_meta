Roth's everyman is a hero whose youthful sense of independence and confidence begins to be challenged when illness commences its attack in middle age. A successful commercial advertising artist, he is the father of two sons who despise him and a daughter who adores him. He is the brother of a good man whose physical well-being comes to arouse his bitter envy. He is the lonely ex-husband of three very different women with whom he has made a mess of marriage.

Roth has been hailed as \"the most compelling of living writers… [His] every book is like a dispatch from the deepest recesses of the national mind.\" In Everyman, Roth once again displays his hallmark incisiveness.
