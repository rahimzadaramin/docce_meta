His ultimate quarry is the detective Bill Hodges, and as Brady gains his faculties—as well as some new paranormal skills (telekinesis anyone?)—people start committing suicide at a mysterious and alarming rate. King hits his sweet spot in this final episode of the Bill Hodges Trilogy, introducing his talent for horror into a storyline that already has featured some great detective writing.
