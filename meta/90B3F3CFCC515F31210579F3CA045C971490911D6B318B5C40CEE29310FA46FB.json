We’re most familiar with the viruses that give us colds or the flu, but viruses also cause a vast range of other diseases, including one disorder that makes people sprout branch-like growths as if they were trees. Viruses have been a part of our lives for so long, in fact, that <em>we</em> are actually part virus: the human genome contains more DNA from viruses than our own genes. Meanwhile, scientists are discovering viruses everywhere they look: in the soil, in the ocean, even in deep caves miles underground. <br></p><p>This fascinating book explores the hidden world of viruses—a world that each of us inhabit. Here Carl Zimmer, popular science writer and author of <em>Discover</em> magazine’s award-winning blog <em>The Loom</em>, presents the latest research on how viruses hold sway over our lives and our biosphere, how viruses helped give rise to the first life-forms, how viruses are producing new diseases, how we can harness viruses for our own ends, and how viruses will continue to control our fate for years to come. In this eye-opening tour through the frontiers of biology, where scientists are expanding our understanding of life as we know it, we learn that some treatments for the common cold do more harm to us than good; that the world’s oceans are home to an astonishing 1,000,000,000,000,­000,000,000,000,000,000 viruses; and that the evolution of HIV is now in overdrive, spawning more mutated strains than we care to imagine. <br></p><p><em>The New York Times Book Review</em> calls Carl Zimmer “as fine a science essayist as we have.” <em>A Planet of Viruses</em> is sure to please his many fans and further enhance his reputation as one of America’s most respected and admired science journalists.</p></div>","dc.identifier":"5b7eeb56-7045-4c7b-ac47-9ecfd1740672","dc.publisher":"University of Chicago Press","dc.subject":["Science","Health","Non-Fiction"],"dcterms.created":"2011-04-01T05:00:00+05:00","description":"<div><h3>Review</h3><p>\"Part of a series sponsored by the Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) to help support educational outreach to students, [<em>A Planet of Viruses</em>] packs into 109 pages just about everything you’ve always wanted to know–and a lot you’ll probably wish you didn’t know–about the viruses that have caused humanity so much grief throughout history.\"—<em>Forbes</em><br></p><p>(<em>Forbes</em> 20110512)<br></p><p>\"For those with long memories, not much seems to have happened in fundamental physics and cosmology since Carl Sagan''s Cosmos, 30 years ago. . . .
