Taking examples from everyday life-from rodeos and circuses to word-processors that replace \"who\" with \"that\" when referring to animals-Bekoff illustrates the lengths to which humans go to convince themselves animals don't think, feel, and suffer like we do. Concerning a topic of growing popularity, Bekoff's arguments can be less than rigorous; an \"unwavering optimist and dreamer,\" he focuses more on anecdotes and emotions (\"alienation from nature... kills our hearts\") than practicalities or a concrete agenda.

From food production to circus acts, drug testing to wildlife encroachment, animals have long been considered objects to be manipulated for the express pleasure and benefit of humans.
