As Irish society undergoes rapid change and we face perhaps the bleakest economic conditions in modern memory, it is not surprising that the issue of mental health has become more prominent and somewhat more openly discussed. The problems of depression and anxiety seem to be the most prevalent with often debilitating effects on the sufferers and their families. However, in many cases, these afflictions can be treated and risks of recurrence significantly reduced.   Applying a system which uses colour-coded flags for various mental states and problems, Dr Barry explains the role our minds and brains play in the manifestation of depression and anxiety, and how these in turn can be shaped to lead us out of illness. The book takes a holistic view and examines the numerous medical, psychlogical and complimentary therapies that can all help in negotiating a pathway out of depression and anxiety  His use of fictionalised case studies makes the book both accessible and easily manageable for all readers. There are colour illustrations and extra appendices at the end of the book including information on self-help groups and resources available.","dc.identifier":"9781907593901","dc.publisher":"Liberties Press","dc.rights":"© Dr Harry Barry, 2011","dcterms.created":"2013","description":"Flagging the Therapy: Pathways Out of Depression and Anxiety follows on from Dr Barry's best-selling book, Flagging the Problem, which was in the Top 5 following its publication in 2007.
