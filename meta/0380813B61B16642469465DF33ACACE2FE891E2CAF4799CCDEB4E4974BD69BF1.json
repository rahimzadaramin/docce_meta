Arranged in three clear parts for ease of use, the Grammar's comprehensive coverage ranges from the very basic--such as word structure, simple and complex phrases, and clause types--to the more sophisticated topics that lie at the intersection of grammar and meaning, including tense and aspect, mood and modality, and information structuring. How do words formed by \"compounding\" differ from words formed by \"conversion\"? How many verbs in English can take a declarative clause functioning as direct object (ie, \"decide that...\" or \"believe that...\")? What is the relationship between a matrix clause and a subordinate clause? What is the present futurate? The past futurate? The present perfect? How does the grammar of English encode such semantic notions as \"possibility,\" \"probability,\" \"necessity,\" \"obligation,\" \"permission,\" \"intention,\" or \"ability\"? Aarts answers all these questions, clearly and engagingly, deeply enriching the reader's understanding of the English language.\nOxford Modern English Grammar will be invaluable for those with an interest in the English language, undergraduate students of all disciplines, and for anyone who would like a clear guide to English grammar and how to use it.","dc.format":"application/pdf; version=1.4","dcterms.created":"2019-08-07T20:07:07Z","description":"Written by Bas Aarts, one of Britain's leading grammarians, Oxford Modern English Grammar is a brand new and definitive guide to English grammar.
