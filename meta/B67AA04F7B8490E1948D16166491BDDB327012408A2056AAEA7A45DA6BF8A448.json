He explains that, actually, whilst individuals play an important role in history, to explain events such as wars, one must look at deeper causes.\nAs well as dealing with the origin of the war, Woods traces the conflict through its development, looking at the role of all the major actors, and their aims. He shows how in the midst of the despair of the trenches and the home front, a new consciousness was formed. \nHe also makes the case that it was the German Revolution that brought the war to an end, and how a revolutionary wave swept across Europe. The book also looks at the Treaty of Versailles and how the victorious powers imposed the deal, not just on Germany, but the rest of Europe and the Middle East.\nGiven the amount of nationalistic mystification from all sides about the First World War, a history of the subject from the standpoint of the world working class is essential and it is provided by this book.","dc.identifier":"urn:uuid:87a60a74-4658-4f3a-ba14-f2de5a796f76","dc.publisher":"Wellred Books","dc.subject":"History : Revolutionary","dcterms.created":"2019-06-21T08:00:00+04:00","description":"On 28 June 1914, two pistol shots shattered the peace of a sunny afternoon in Sarajevo.
