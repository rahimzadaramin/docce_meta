The Wild West isn’t safe for a woman alone, but she isn’t about to marry for anything but love. Her charitable efforts put her in touch with all manner of people, and while she’s respectable, she causes gossip around the small town as she tries to help prostitutes and orphans. Still, she does want a family of her own.\nTwo handsome young men catch Emily’s eye, but Jack and Henry are so close. How can she pick one of them without destroying their friendship and their partnership? When she finds them in a compromising position, she’s shocked and intrigued. Emily never considered herself conventional, but the men open her eyes even more to how inclusive and varied love can be. Society would never approve, yet it doesn’t feel wrong for the trio. Being courted by two men at once is wild, but committing herself to them is pure madness and pure ecstasy as well. They must keep their ménage secret until they’re sure how to plan a future together so no one will suspect or discover the truth. 1878 isn’t ready for what they have to offer.","dc.identifier":"Runaway Cowgirl","dc.publisher":"Totally Bound Publishing","dc.subject":"Erotic Romance Fiction","dcterms.created":"2014","description":"Emily isn’t about to marry just any man, but falling in love with two hot ranchers might be more than this respectable young lady can handle.\nEmily St. Claire is wealthy, beautiful, young and very eligible to the single men of Manitou Springs, Colorado.
