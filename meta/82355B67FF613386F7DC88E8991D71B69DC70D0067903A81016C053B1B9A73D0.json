You will discover: •The fascinating world that is your skin, and what makes it tick – information that is crucial to you making an informed decision about any aspect of your lifestyle/antiaging skincare •How and Why wrinkles develop in your once flawless skin, and 15 major factors (there could be one or two you hadn’t thought of) that can accelerate the rate of your skin’s natural aging process by as much as 100%. If this doesn’t shock you into action then nothing will! •NICHE SECRET REVEALED!

Discover the answer to this in Section Two… •How chemicals used in oven cleaners and anti-freeze are turning up in organic skincare – and how instead, you can boost your skin’s natural properties to tighten and tone from within •NICHE SECRET REVEALED! Why applying daily moisturizer can actually be a death sentence for your skin (this is not what you think, and is intended to slightly agitate your ideas about skincare and antiaging!) •The truth about what’s in most of the processed and packaged food you buy, and what big-brand food companies don’t tell you about their so-called “healthy” products in the name of profit.
