And she did find him - just days before Jess nearly got him hung.\n\nAll Jess wanted to do was show a good man a city's gratitude. Instead, he signed the man's death warrant. He could put a con-man out of business with the stroke of his pen. Literally. But in his first weeks on the job as investigative reporter for the New York Times, Jess wrote an article that re-opened a twenty-year-old criminal case. This time his pen set in motion a chain of events that exposed a good Samaritan to the men who wanted him dead.\n\nNow, corruption and greed bring Addie and Jess to the brink of terror when his column puts a target on her father's back, and Jess must discover not only who wants this good man dead, but how to save the woman who has captured his heart.","dc.identifier":"7a0a32a7-f58f-4585-8b8f-1f1ce147e9e6","dc.publisher":"Prairie Muse Publishing","dcterms.created":"2011-10-26T12:00:00+05:00","description":"Addie is abducted, her father is about to be hung, all because of Jess Pepper's investigative reporting in 1896 New York City.\n\nBeautiful and talented, Addie came to the city with little more than a violin tucked beneath her chin and enough moxie to launch her dream - and find the father she hadn't seen in sixteen years.
