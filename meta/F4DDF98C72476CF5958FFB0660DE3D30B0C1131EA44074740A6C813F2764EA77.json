The personal associations triggered by a full moon, the running monologue with which she stays sane--we who have been lost in woods will recognize these things.","ibsn":"9780671042851","subject":"Suspense; Fiction; thriller; General; Horror; Psychological Fiction; Psychological; Fiction - Horror; Horror - General; Literary; Appalachian Trail; Stephen; StephenKing; King; Missing children; Appalachian Region; Pitchers (Baseball); Children of divorced parents; Fear in children; Mountain life","publisheddate":"1999-10-15 15:00:00+08:00","contributor":"calibre (0.7.23) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","updatedtitle":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","fieldlist":{"author":"Stephen King","contributor":"calibre (0.7.23) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","description":"SUMMARY: Trisha McFarland is a plucky 9-year-old hiking with her brother and mom, who is grimly determined to give the kids a good time on their weekends together.
