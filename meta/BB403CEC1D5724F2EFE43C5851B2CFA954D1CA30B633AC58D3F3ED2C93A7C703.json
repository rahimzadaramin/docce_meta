Revered for the candor of her groundbreaking creative nonfiction, beginning with The Woman Warrior (1976), and her playful and profound fiction, Kingston gracefully entwines both genres as she reflects on turning 65, shares piquant stories of family, and catches up with her characters, especially Wittman Ah Sung, who first appeared in Tripmaster Monkey (1989). Kingston’s descriptions of the timeless beauty and evolving struggle of village life in China are mystical and incisive, while wry humor shapes her account of being arrested during a 2003 peace demonstration at the White House. Looking back to her California childhood as the daughter of immigrants, Kingston remembers wanting to ask others, “How do you feel being you?” That is the writer’s great question, and the wellspring of Kingston’s artistry and deep compassion. --Donna Seaman </p>\n\n</div>","ibsn":"9780307270191","subject":"Autobiography","publisheddate":"2011-01-17 10:00:00+00:00","contributor":"calibre (0.7.57) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","rights":"Copyright © 2011 by Maxine Hong Kingston","source":"calibre:44c10b3b-6347-4ef8-8452-2a05851d9b2a","asin":"bc30bbc4-5730-4331-8281-9665ecdc0b17","cdetype":"EBOK","updatedtitle":"I Love a Broad Margin to My Life","fieldlist":{"asin":"bc30bbc4-5730-4331-8281-9665ecdc0b17","author":"Maxine Hong Kingston","cdetype":"EBOK","contributor":"calibre (0.7.57) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","description":"<div><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Told in free verse reminiscent of one of Kingston's idols, Walt Whitman, this uncommon memoir of the artist at 65 is informed by the wide margins on the pages of the Chinese editions of her works (margins her father used to write in).
