In an increasingly divided society, Iain examines why we've all become so disrespectful and intolerant. Using experiences from his career in politics and the media, he says it doesn't have to be this way, and suggests how we can all emerge from tribalism and division and become more respectful to each other and those who govern us. It is a book that is optimistic about the fundamental decencies embedded in human nature and uses deeply personal anecdotes to explain why we can look forward in a positive way to a better life both in personal and material terms.","dc.identifier":"9780008379148","dc.publisher":"HarperCollins Publishers","dc.rights":"All Rights Reserved","dcterms.created":"2020-06-16T16:25:39Z","description":"Why Can't We All Just Get Along is part-memoir, part-polemic about the state of public discourse in Britain and the world today.
