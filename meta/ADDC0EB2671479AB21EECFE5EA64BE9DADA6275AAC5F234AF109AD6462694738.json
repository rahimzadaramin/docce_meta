As a corrective to recent trends in criticism, acclaimed translator and critic Clare Cavanagh demonstrates how the practice of the personal lyric in totalitarian states such as Russia and Poland did not represent an escapist tendency; rather it reverberated as a bold political statement and at times a dangerous act.<p>Cavanagh also provides a comparative study of modern poetry from the perspective of the eastern and western sides of the Iron Curtain.
