Though many instructional books are available, few focus on the aspects of the program that are significant to a photography workflow. Adobe Certified Instructor Steve Laskevitch uses his experience as a teacher and practitioner to create a guide for a clear, effective workflow for editing photographs in the 2014 release of Photoshop CC and its companions: Bridge, Camera Raw, and Lightroom 5. Focusing on the critical elements of a workflow, this book is designed to get you working quickly. The various applications are presented side-by-side so that a user of one can learn how to use the others. If you’re a new user, this book will be your roadmap.","dc.identifier":"urn:uuid:A3FB70D5-BB0B-4FFB-BB40-19E43DD010F4","dc.publisher":"Rocky Nook","dc.rights":"© 2014. All rights reserved.
