In fact, scholars say, the Inca had a highly refined metallurgy, but valued plasticity over strength. What defeated the Inca was not steel but smallpox and resulting internecine warfare. Mann also shows that the Maya constructed huge cities and governed them with a cohesive set of political ideals. Most notably, according to Mann, the Haudenosaunee, in what is now the Northeast U.S., constructed a loose confederation of tribes governed by the principles of individual liberty and social equality. The author also weighs the evidence that Native populations were far larger than previously calculated. Mann, a contributor to the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> and <em>Science</em>, masterfully assembles a diverse body of scholarship into a first-rate history of Native America and its inhabitants. 56 b&amp;w photos, 15 maps. <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
