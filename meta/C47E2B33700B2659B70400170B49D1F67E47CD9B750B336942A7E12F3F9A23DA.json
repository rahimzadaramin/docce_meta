In the third installment of the Scrapyard Ship sci-fi adventure series, Space Vengeance, Jason, his family, and The Lilly's crew face the impending destruction of their internal nano-devices. What's worse, what remains of the Craing fleet, some 1500 warships, is back and headed straight toward the already decimated planets within Allied space. In what looks to be a one-way suicide mission, Jason must leave Nan and Mollie behind on Earth and out of harm’s way. While war rages on sixty light years from Earth, maniacal space raider Captain Stalls and hundreds of his pirated warships close in on Earth. Stalls knows exactly what he wants: to find and kill Captain Reynolds and take the beautiful Nan Reynolds for his own.
