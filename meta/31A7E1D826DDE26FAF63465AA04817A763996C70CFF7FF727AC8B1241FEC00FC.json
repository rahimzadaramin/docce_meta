A woman who remembers nothing &#8212; except the distant past. Visiting Sarah Tolley seemed a small enough sacrifice to make.<p>But Laura's promise results in another death. Her husband's. And after their five-year-old daughter, Emma, witnesses her father's suicide, Emma refuses to talk about it to talk at all.<p>Frantic and guilt ridden, Laura contacts the only person who may be able to help. A man she's met only once &#8212; six years before. A man who doesn't know he's Emma's real father.<p>Guided only by a child's silence and an old woman's fading memories, the two unravel a tale of love and despair, of bravery and unspeakable evil.
