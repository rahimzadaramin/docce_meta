She started writing as a hobby and became addicted to creating characters and stories. Since then, she has won numerous writing awards for her paranormal romance and romantic-suspense fiction. Nominated for an International Thriller Award for Best First Novel, her debut book, She Can Run, sold over 100,000 copies within six months and was the number one bestseller in both Kindle Romantic Suspense and Mystery/Thriller. When she isn’t writing, Melinda is an avid martial artist: she holds a second-degree black belt in Kenpo karate and teaches women’s self-defense. She lives in a messy house with her husband, two teenagers, a couple of dogs, and two rescue cats. </p></div>","dc.identifier":"f3151590-4658-40fa-a66a-120a924531c6","dc.publisher":"AmazonEncore","dc.subject":["Romance","Thrillers","General","Suspense","Fiction"],"dcterms.created":"2013-04-16T09:00:00+05:00","description":"<div><p><em>One by one, people are mysteriously disappearing from a small Maine town. </em></p><p>Four months ago, a ruthless murderer killed two people and kidnapped three more, including Danny Sullivan’s sister, who barely escaped.
