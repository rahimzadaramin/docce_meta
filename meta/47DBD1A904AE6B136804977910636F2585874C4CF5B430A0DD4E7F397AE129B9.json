You've seen him on the street, in bars, on the underground, at restaurants: a twenty-something guy, nice suit, works in advertising. Regular. Ordinary. But when the ordinary person had two drinks, Augusten had twelve; when the ordinary person went home at midnight, Augusten never went home at all. At the request (well, it wasn't really a request) of his employers, Augusten lands in rehab, where his dreams of group therapy with Robert Downey Jr are dashed by the grim reality of fluorescent lighting and paper hospital slippers. But when Augusten is forced to examine himself, that's when he finds himself in the worst trouble of all. Because when his thirty days are up, he has to return to his same drunken life - and live it sober.","dc.format":"304 pages","dc.identifier":"9780857895172","dc.publisher":"Atlantic Books Ltd","dc.rights":"All rights reserved","dc.type":"Text","dcterms.created":"2011","description":"<p>You may not know it, but you've met Augusten Burroughs.
