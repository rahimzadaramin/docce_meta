Their name alone conjures up images of power, violence and greed - and even brother Charlie couldn't steer the twins Ron and Reg clear of murder mayhem as they killed their way to the top of the criminal tree. They lived by their own rules. And they died by them. The three brothers will never be forgotten. They are an indelible part of our history, whether we like it or not. And from media manipulation to control freak paranoia, The Krays were masters of deception. Even at the end Reg Kray was still portraying himself as just an ordinary East Ender - mistreated by the Home Office and the police, misunder-stood and mistakenly labelled `Godfather of Crime' by the media. The Kray Anthology traces their history from childhood and early adolescence to manhood and death. This book explores the brothers' fantasy lives, full as they were of mind games and false memories. Whatever you want to know about the Krays and the real reasons behind their success, you can read it here for the first time. Only now can the truth be revealed - without fear of intimidation, retribution or revenge. The Krays are dead and buried, but the myth lives on.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: 'MS Shell Dlg 2', sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">**</p></div>","dc.identifier":"4d13864f-a00e-44e6-b3d3-ae3ad8be4b67","dc.publisher":"Mainstream Digital","dc.subject":["Criminology","True Crime","Crime","Biography","Organized Crime","Non-Fiction","Criminals","Memoirs","Social Sciences","Gangs","Politics"],"dcterms.created":"2011-11-25T04:00:00+04:00","description":"<div><p><b>The Ultimate Biography of Ron, Reg and Charlie Kray . . .</b></p><p style=\"font-family: 'MS Shell Dlg 2', sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">The Krays were a product of their age, nurtured by a doting mother and created by their community, the East End of London.
