Heading towards the nearest town of Hope to collect the reward money, he discovers the outlaw worked for Brewster Fontaine, who owns everything and everyone in the town&#8212;including the bank. But, Fontaine has no intention of paying out bounty money for having one of his own men killed. Summoning his hired guns back into town, he orders them to kill Iron Eyes if he tries to enter the bank. Unknown to Fontaine, this man is no ordinary bounty hunter who can be frightened like regular folk. Here, instead, is a man who will wage war no matter how many guns he must face.","dc.identifier":"9780709098027","dc.publisher":"Robert Hale","dc.rights":"© Rory Black 2006","dcterms.created":"2012","description":"<p>In the lawless wilds of Arizona Territory, infamous bounty hunter Iron Eyes dishes out his own brand of justice and adds another outlaw to his tally.
