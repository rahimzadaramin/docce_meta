Suffice it to say that as with many series featuring a recurring character, there is a bit of a formula at work (one that fans will love). Again, brilliant Harvard professor Robert Langdon finds himself in a predicament that requires his vast knowledge of symbology and superior problem-solving skills to save the day. The setting, unlike other Robert Langdon novels, is stateside, and in Brown's hands Washington D.C. is as fascinating as Paris or Vatican City (note to the D.C. tourism board: get your \"Lost Symbol\" tour in order). And, as with other Dan Brown books, the pace is relentless, the revelations many, and there is an endless parade of intriguing factoids that will make you feel like you are spending the afternoon with Robert Langdon and the guys from </em>Mythbusters*. <br></p><p>Nothing is as it seems in a Robert Langdon novel, and <em>The Lost Symbol</em> itself is no exception--a page-turner to be sure, but Brown also challenges his fans to open their minds to new information. Skeptical? Imagine how many other thrillers would spawn millions of Google searches for noetic science, superstring theory, and <em>Apotheosis of Washington</em>. <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is brain candy of the best sort--just make sure to set aside time to enjoy your meal. <em>--Daphne Durham</em> <br></p><hr><p><strong><br></strong><strong>More from Dan Brown</strong></p><p><em>The Da Vinci Code</em><em>Angels &amp; Demons</em><em>Deception Point</em><em>Digital Fortress</em></p><h3>From Publishers Weekly</h3><p>Starred Review. After scores of Da Vinci Code knockoffs, spinoffs, copies and caricatures, Brown has had the stroke of brilliance to set his breakneck new thriller not in some far-off exotic locale, but right here in our own backyard. Everyone off the bus, and welcome to a Washington, D.C., they never told you about on your school trip when you were a kid, a place steeped in Masonic history that, once revealed, points to a dark, ancient conspiracy that threatens not only America but the world itself. Returning hero Robert Langdon comes to Washington to give a lecture at the behest of his old mentor, Peter Solomon. When he arrives at the U.S. Capitol for his lecture, he finds, instead of an audience, Peter's severed hand mounted on a wooden base, fingers pointing skyward to the Rotunda ceiling fresco of George Washington dressed in white robes, ascending to heaven. Langdon teases out a plethora of clues from the tattooed hand that point toward a secret portal through which an intrepid seeker will find the wisdom known as the Ancient Mysteries, or the lost wisdom of the ages. A villain known as Mal'akh, a steroid-swollen, fantastically tattooed, muscle-bodied madman, wants to locate the wisdom so he can rule the world. Mal'akh has captured Peter and promises to kill him if Langdon doesn't agree to help find the portal. Joining Langdon in his search is Peter's younger sister, Kathleen, who has been conducting experiments in a secret museum. This is just the kickoff for a deadly chase that careens back and forth, across, above and below the nation's capital, darting from revelation to revelation, pausing only to explain some piece of wondrous, historical esoterica. Jealous thriller writers will despair, doubters and nay-sayers will be proved wrong, and readers will rejoice: Dan Brown has done it again. </p></div>","ibsn":"9780385504225","subject":"Fiction; Suspense; Political; Fiction - Espionage; Secret societies; Cryptographers; American Mystery & Suspense Fiction; Thrillers; Thriller; American; Suspense fiction; Adventure stories; Signs and symbols; Washington (D.C.); Social Science; Langdon; Adventure fiction; Freemasonry; Large type books; Freemasonry - Symbolism; Robert (Fictitious character)","publisheddate":"2009-09-15 00:00:00+05:30","contributor":"calibre (0.9.18) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","source":"calibre:6c5ccceb-d268-4a41-ae99-fd51342ed09c","asin":"6c5ccceb-d268-4a41-ae99-fd51342ed09c","cdetype":"EBOK","updatedtitle":"The Lost Symbol","fieldlist":{"asin":"6c5ccceb-d268-4a41-ae99-fd51342ed09c","author":"Dan Brown","cdetype":"EBOK","contributor":"calibre (0.9.18) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","description":"<div><p>In this stunning follow-up to the global phenomenon <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, Dan Brown demonstrates once again why he is the world’s most popular thriller writer. <em>The Lost Symbol</em> is a masterstroke of storytelling--a deadly race through a real-world labyrinth of codes, secrets, and unseen truths . . . all under the watchful eye of Brown’s most terrifying villain to date.
