Western civilization was saved by the rise of capitalism, which tamed the activities of money lending, and endowed them with socially redeeming value, tethering finance to expanding production of material goods and increased social wealth. Now, as the 21st century begins, bloating tides of money with no possibility of ever being converted into real capital wash over the world. Finance again has turned to its dark side, using money to make money with no socially redeeming purpose. Such is the endgame of economies managed by capitalists without capitalism. As Marx foresaw, capitalist society, like all others, is destined to be outpaced by history as the conditions of its existence decompose and become a drag on the human future. Either we will succeed in bringing about new politico-economic structures&#8212;or civilization will collapse into barbarism, just as usury broke it down in the past.","dc.identifier":"9780997287004","dc.publisher":"SCB Distributors","dc.rights":"© by 2016 Richard Westra","description":"<p>Usury laid medieval society to waste.
