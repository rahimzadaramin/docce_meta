From the large multi-million line long monolithic applications, we are now seeing the benefits of smaller self-contained services.

Easier to change, deploy, and if required retire, organizations which are in the right position to take advantage of them are yielding significant benefits. This book takes an holistic view of the things you need to be cognizant of in order to pull this off.
