Richard's grandfather Zedd goes off to combat the Chimes while Richard and Kahlan, accompanied by Du Chaillu, a pregnant spirit woman who is bound to Richard by an ancient prophesy, travel to Anderith to find the journal of a wizard who defeated the Chimes in ages past. But in Anderith, the rivalry between the Ander and Haken peoples (somewhat heavily handled, with overtones of the author's pro-colonial opinions) threatens to divide the land just when it needs unity in order to defend itself against an invasion by Emperor Jagang's thuggish hordes. After many suspenseful moments, everything comes somewhat raggedly together in a happy ending. Notable for its engaging secondary characters, the novel also evinces flashes of sly wit, as when an evil Chime takes the form of a menacing chicken.
