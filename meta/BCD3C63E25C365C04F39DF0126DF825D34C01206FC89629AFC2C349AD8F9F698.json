But this book is different. It's about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose. \n\n\n\n There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there's a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there's no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. \n\n\n\n Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they're indispensable. And in today's world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom. \n\n\n\n Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn't reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. *Linchpin* will show you how to join the likes of... \n\n\n\n *Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. \n\n *Marissa Mayer, who keeps Google focused on the things that really matter. \n\n *Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a résumé. \n\n *David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffeeshop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. \n\n\n\n As Godin writes, \"Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It's time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious.
