I heartily<br>recommend it to all the students who take DevelopMentor’s WPF course! Anyone serious about doing<br>WPF work should have a copy in their library.”<br>--<strong>Mark Smith</strong>, DevelopMentor instructor, author of DevelopMentor’s Essential WPF course<br></p><p>“I have read<em> Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed</em> from cover to cover and have found it to be<br>really the most comprehensive material on WPF. I can’t think of even a single instance when I have not<br>been able to find the solution (or a pointer to one) every time that I have picked up the book to figure<br>out the intricacies of WPF.”<br>--<strong>Durgesh Nayak</strong>, team leader, Axis Technical Group<br></p><p>“<em>Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed</em> is the book that made WPF make so much sense for me.<br>Without Adam’s work, WPF would still be a mystery to me and my team. The enthusiasm for WPF is<br>evident from the offset and it really rubs off on the reader.”<br>--<strong>Peter O’Hanlon</strong>, managing director, Lifestyle Computing Ltd<br></p><p>“Adam Nathan’s <em>Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed</em> must surely be considered one of the<br>seminal books on WPF. It has everything you need to help you get to grips with the learning cliff that<br>is WPF. It certainly taught me loads, and even now, after several years of full-time WPF development,<br><em>Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed</em> is never far from my hand.”<br>--<strong>Sacha Barber</strong>, Microsoft MVP, CodeProject MVP, author of many WPF articles<br></p><p>“Of all the books published about WPF, there are only three that I recommend. <em>Windows Presentation<br>Foundation Unleashed</em> is my primary recommendation to developers looking to get up to speed quickly<br>with WPF.”<br>--<strong>Mike Brown</strong>, Microsoft MVP, Client App Development, and president of KharaSoft, Inc. </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p><strong>Adam Nathan </strong>is a principal software architect for Microsoft in the Startup Business Group.
