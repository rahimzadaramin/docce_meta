He observes the hilarious complaints that overworked monks, their hands cramped from writing, sometimes added to the margins of the texts they were copying:<br></p><p>'The parchment is hairy'; 'Thin ink, bad parchment, difficult text'; 'Thank God, it will soon be dark'; 'Now I’ve written the whole thing. For Christ’s sake give me a drink.'<br></p><p><em>On the Nature of Things</em> was filled with, to Christian eyes, scandalous ideas. It argues eloquently, Mr. Greenblatt writes, that 'there is no master plan, no divine architect, no intelligent design.' Religious fear, Lucretius thought, long before there was a Christopher Hitchens, warps human life.<br></p><p>There is abundant evidence here of what is Mr. Greenblatt’s great and rare gift as a writer: an ability, to borrow a phrase from <em>The Swerve</em>, to feel fully 'the concentrated force of the buried past.'” (<em>New York Times</em> )<br></p><p>“In this outstandingly constructed assessment of the birth of philosophical modernity, renowned Shakespeare scholar Greenblatt deftly transports reader to the dawn of the Renaissance...Readers from across the humanities will find this enthralling account irresistible.” (starred review - <em>Library Journal</em> )<br></p><p>“Every tale of the preservation of intellectual history should be as rich and satisfying as Stephen Greenblatt's history of the reclamation and acclamation of Lucretius's <em>De rerum natura</em> from obscurity.” (John McFarland - <em>Shelf Awareness</em> )<br></p><p>“In this gloriously learned page-turner, both biography and intellectual history, Harvard Shakespearean scholar Greenblatt turns his attention to the front end of the Renaissance as the origin of Western culture's foundation: the free questioning of truth.” (starred review - <em>Publishers Weekly</em> )<br></p><p>“<em>The Swerve</em> is one of those brilliant works of non-fiction that's so jam-packed with ideas and stories it literally boggles the mind.” (Maureen Corrigan - <em>WHYY-FM/Fresh Air</em> )<br></p><p>“But <em>Swerve</em> is an intense, emotional telling of a true story, one with much at stake for all of us. And the further you read, the more astonishing it becomes. It's a chapter in how we became what we are, how we arrived at the worldview of the present. No one can tell the whole story, but Greenblatt seizes on a crucial pivot, a moment of recovery, of transmission, as amazing as anything in fiction.” (<em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em> )<br></p><p>“In <em>The Swerve</em>, the literary historian Stephen Greenblatt investigates why [Lucretius' ] book nearly dies, how it was saved and what its rescue means to us.” (Sarah Bakewell - <em>New York Times Book Reivew</em> ) </p><h3>About the Author</h3><p><strong>Stephen Greenblatt </strong>(Ph.D. Yale) is Cogan University Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University.
