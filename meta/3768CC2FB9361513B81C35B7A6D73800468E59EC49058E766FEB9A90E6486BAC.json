And it sure does. <br>It is the Summer of 2006. Gay marriage and transgender rights are in the air, and Casey has thrust herself into a wild lesbian subculture. Soon Adam is tagging along to underground clubs, where there are hot older women everywhere he turns. It takes some time for him to realize that many in this new crowd assume he is trans -- a boy who was born a girl. Why else would this baby-faced guy always be around? <br>Then Adam meets Gillian, the girl of his dreams -- but she couldn't possibly be interested in him. Unless passing as a trans guy might actually work in his favor...<br>Ariel Schrag's scathingly funny and poignant debut novel puts a fresh spin on questions of love, attraction, self-definition, and what it takes to be at home in your own skin. </p><p>**</p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>Schrag switches gears from her autobiographical graphic-novel series, High School Chronicles of Ariel Schrag, and turns to fiction, undertaking a major challenge. She attempts to convey the thoughts, voice, actions, and mind-set of a straight, wealthy 17-year-old California boy determined to meet the love of his life. She succeeds in being on target in tone, but the plot strains credulity. Adam hasn’t even made out with a girl yet, so how does spending the summer with his older lesbian sister in New York City help with his quest? Casey, very much on the gay scene socially and politically, does take him places, and he even meets the redhead of his dreams. But Gillian, an attractive lesbian in her early twenties, beds Adam because she believes his deceitful claim that he is a female-to-male transsexual. To live this lie, he devises various deceptions involving bungee cords (don’t ask). He can’t share his outrageous secret with Casey, or her sometime lover, Butch Casey (again, don’t ask), or apartment mate June, who lusts after Casey. Finally it is Ethan, who also shares the apartment, who becomes Adam’s mentor in Schrag’s unusual, very explicit coming-of-age novel. --Whitney Scott </p><h3>Review</h3><p>\"The book is sincere, dirty (but not in an excessive way), and downright hilarious. Schrag somehow manages to walk the increasingly thin tightrope of being respectful and yet brutally honest about transgender issues...While this book will surely be on the summer reading list for anybody with a family member or dear friend that fits under the LGBT umbrella, it could and should be enjoyable to anybody who picks it up.
