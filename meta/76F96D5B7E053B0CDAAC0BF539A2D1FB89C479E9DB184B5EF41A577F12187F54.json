The scholarly afterword to this meticulous volume mentions the recent film adaptation of Fitzgerald's Jazz Age story, but it would be a mistake to assume that this volume has been created simply because of the media tie-in. It is a strikingly literal adaptation, re-creating dialogue, narration, and even chapter breaks with an assured and deliberate hand. While Fitzgerald's light tone is well preserved, it is the artwork that is the most striking, despite what could be construed as a dour use of gray and sepia. It is highly evocative, with an excellent use of facial expression to moving and comic effect. As the story obviously must address the particulars of physical age, Cornell depicts not just the transformation of Benjamin's face, but also his changing poise and confidence with well-rendered body language. While a thoroughly fine work, the lightly funny, softly satiric material will not produce peals of laughter, and the subject matter may strike teens as more unusual than engaging. Still, this is a work of quality that should find a small but appreciative audience.—_Benjamin Russell, Belmont High School, NH_ <br>Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
