I love you is a heart-warming debut by cecilia ahern. It is a wonderfully warm and heartfelt love story about childhood sweethearts. Some people wait their whole lives to find their soul mates, but not holly and gerry. As childhood sweethearts, they always knew they were meant to be together. Holly and gerry could finish each other's sentences and even when they fought, they laughed. No one could imagine them without each other. A brain tumor brings turmoil to their lives and gerry's death devastates holly. As her 30th birthday looms, gerry comes back to her. He's left her a bundle of notes, one for each month after his death. He is with her even beyond death, gently guiding her new life without him. Each of his notes is signed 'p.s. I love you'. As the notes are gradually opened and as the year unfolds, holly is both cheered up and challenged. The man who knows her better than anyone else sets out to teach her that life goes on. With some help from her friends and her noisy and loving family, holly finds herself laughing, crying, singing and dancing. Brave as she is, she realizes that everyone needs a guardian angel. Life is for living, she realizes. P.s.
