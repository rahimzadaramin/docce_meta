Here for the first time the personal stories of those involved, both abusers and survivors, are presented with profound psychological insight. Five priest abusers reveal the personal tragedy behind the terrible betrayals they committed. Told in their own words—words of anger, repentance, and even self-delusion—they share their struggles with the dark forces that led them to abuse those in their care. And they give us insight into their difficult road to recovery. Silent no more, the survivors reveal the pain, trauma, shame, and devastation they have experienced at the hands of those they trusted most. We witness their courage as they go on to seek healing and peace with the past. Anyone serious about understanding the clergy abuse scandals, and everyone dedicated to building a world where such atrocities can never happen again, must read this book.","dc.identifier":"9780824550110","dc.publisher":"The Crossroad Publishing Company","dc.rights":"All rights reserved","dcterms.created":"2007","description":"From Boston to Los Angeles, Catholic sexual abuse scandals have been widely coverd in the media.
