If you'd like to build an electronic device, but don't have much experience with electronics components, this hands-on workbench reference helps you find answers to technical questions quickly. Filling the gap between a beginner's primer and a formal textbook, Practical Electronics explores aspects of electronic components, techniques, and tools that you would typically learn on the job and from years of experience.","dc.identifier":"urn:uuid:18262335-6dda-41f0-8d41-a5a4f4368f79","dc.publisher":"O'Reilly Media","dcterms.created":"2015-03-16T02:00:00+04:00","description":"How much do you need to know about electronics to create something interesting, or creatively modify something that already exists?
