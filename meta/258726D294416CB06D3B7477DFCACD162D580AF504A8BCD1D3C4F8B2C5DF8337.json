Tired of being told to “write a little bit a day every day?” How’s that advice working for you? It’s not, is it? </p>\n<p>If it <em>was</em> , your novel would be written already. But I hear you—writing fiction isn't easy. When I first learned how to write a novel, that “helpful” information … wasn't. I went slowly, plodded along, writing a little each day like all the authors told me to. Then I would get disinterested or distracted and my novel would get DElayed! </p>\n<p>You’ve listened to the podcasts on writing skills, taken the fiction writing workshops, read how to write a novel guides, but your novel still isn't written. Are you <em>still</em> waiting for that “1 hour a day” conventional wisdom to pay off? </p>\n<h2>Let's face it, it's a new ballgame for indie authors!</h2>\n<p>A numbers game. The number of fiction books you publish, reviews you get, and downloads you can expect are all partly a function of how many words you write—how many novels you publish. Conventional “wisdom” is getting us nowhere. </p>\n<h3>It’s time to take a different approach!</h3>\n<p>Wouldn't it be great to have a finished novel to show for all your hard work?

That's what I want to show you how to do, because I've been there. </p>\n<p>In this step-by-step fiction writing workshop—feels more like boot camp adrenaline sprint—Steve Windsor walks you through how he writes novels in 9 “days.” With concrete examples of how to apply story structure, outlining, plotting and a generous dose of hard work, you'll learn to drive your hero through his or her story. </p>\n<p>You CAN write a novel in less time than it takes you to need your next haircut. Steve shows you how blockbuster novels and movies use a formula that’s as old as Aristotle to produce hits. </p>\n<h2>Packed with examples!</h2>\n<p>Using examples from his own novels, he even makes up a story right before your eyes! Steve is a hands on hardcore writer who will show you just how “easy” it is. </p>\n<p>Make no mistake, the <em>Nine Day Novel, Fiction Writing Basics</em> series isn’t for everyone.
