A bargirl takes a flyer off the Hannibal Bridge and creates a good headline for a Kansas City Star reporter. But for Dorie the woman's end is just the beginning.<br>\n</p>\n<p><strong>Sweet and Lowdown</strong> is an homage to Raymond Chandler's <strong>The Big Sleep.</strong> It's set in 1940, the year Chandler's famous mystery appeared in print, and finally we find out what happened to the chauffeur, a mystery Chandler never solved himself. As PW said: In Kansas City, PI Dorie Lennox and her partner, Amos Haddam, are tailing Thalia Hines, the wayward 21-year-old daughter of a prominent local family. (Not the least of this mystery's myriad pleasures is the author's tip of the hat to Raymond Chandler's <strong>The Big Sleep</strong>.) </p>\n<p>After many years of prodding and pleading from a fan I wrote one more Dorie Lennox tale, a short story that takes place just after Pearl Harbor in 1941. War is on, but for Dorie, well, it's complicated. It takes place on a train ride between St. Louis and Kansas City in the middle of a blizzard: that is <strong>Snow Train.</strong></p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy the box set.
