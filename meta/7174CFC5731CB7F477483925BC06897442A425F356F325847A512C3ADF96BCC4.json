Knocking on Heaven’s Door is an exhilarating and accessible overview of these developments and an impassioned argument for the significance of science. There could be no better guide than Lisa Randall. The bestselling author of Warped Passages is an expert in both particle physics (the study of the smallest objects we know of) and cosmology (the study of the largest). In Knocking on Heaven’s Door, she explores how we decide which scientific questions to study and how we go about answering them. She examines the role of risk, creativity, uncertainty, beauty, and truth in scientific thinking through provocative conversations with leading figures in other fields (such as the chef David Chang, the forecaster Nate Silver, and the screenwriter Scott Derrickson), and she explains with wit and clarity the latest ideas in physics and cosmology. Randall describes the nature and goals of the largest machine ever built: the Large Hadron Collider, the enormous particle accelerator below the border of France and Switzerland—as well as recent ideas underlying cosmology and current dark matter experiments. The most sweeping and exciting science book in years, Knocking on Heaven’s Door makes clear the biggest scientific questions we face and reveals how answering them could ultimately tell us who we are and where we came from.","ibsn":"9780061723728","publisheddate":"2011-11-06T01:22:03+04:00","contributor":"calibre (0.8.24) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","rights":"All rights reserved","asin":"db41eb2a-c98f-4b62-9ce9-1c8faac66fe9","cdetype":"EBOK","updatedtitle":"Knocking on Heaven's Door","fieldlist":{"asin":"db41eb2a-c98f-4b62-9ce9-1c8faac66fe9","author":"Lisa Randall","cdetype":"EBOK","contributor":"calibre (0.8.24) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","description":"From one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world, a rousing defense of the role of science in our lives The latest developments in physics have the potential to radically revise our understanding of the world: its makeup, its evolution, and the fundamental forces that drive its operation.
