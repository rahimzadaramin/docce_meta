With this practical guide, you'll learn how to write Swift code and examine why this language works the way it does. You'll build three complete apps, all tightly linked together: an iOS note-taking app, its OS X counterpart that uses iCloud to sync data, and an app for the Apple Watch that makes the user's data available at a moment's notice.      This book also explains how Swift works in the wider world, including how to use your apps with open-source frameworks, how to use extensions to help your app play nicely with other apps, and how to take the language beyond Apple's domain with open-source Swift tools. Get started with Swift today and quickly learn how you can build on its foundations."},{"property":"dcterms:creator","text":"Jonathan Manning, Paris Buttfield-Addison, Tim Nugent"},{"name":"cover"},{"property":"ibooks:specified-fonts","text":true}]},"sha256":"4E68DE02DF56084A9611222E149F6D92B9B34A7118244E6D70D6A697218E9958","clean.language":"en,[\r\n  \"en\"\r\n]","clean.title":"learning swift","clean.author":"paris buttfield-addison","clean.creator":"paris buttfield-addison"}
