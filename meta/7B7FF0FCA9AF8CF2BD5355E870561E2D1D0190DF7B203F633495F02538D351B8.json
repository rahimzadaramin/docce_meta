In the wake of her mother's rapid death from cancer, her family disbanded and her marriage crumbled. With nothing to lose, she made the most impulsive decision of her life: to walk eleven-hundred miles of the west coast of America - from the Mojave Desert, through California and Oregon, and into Washington state - and to do it alone. She had no experience of long-distance hiking and the journey was nothing more than a line on a map. But it held a promise - a promise of piecing together a life that lay in ruins at her feet. Strayed's account captures the agonies - both mental and physical - of her incredible journey; how it maddened and terrified her, and how, ultimately, it healed her. Wild is a brutal memoir of survival, grief and redemption: a searing portrayal of life at its lowest ebb and at its highest tide.","dc.identifier":"16387265","dc.publisher":"Atlantic Books Ltd","dc.rights":"Copyright © Cheryl Strayed, 2012","dcterms.created":"0101-01-01T04:00:00+04:00","description":"At twenty-six, Cheryl Strayed thought she had lost everything.
