I love reading just as much as I love writing. I relish the sheer escapism of losing myself in a book that grips me and takes me on an emotional roller coaster. I love a good steamy romance and I adore sexy alpha males. I also have more than a passing interest in BDSM (nod, nod … wink, wink) but I found that I was often left frustrated by the lack of books that were both well written and ‘true’ to the lifestyle. In sheer frustration one day, I put pen to paper (well fingers to keyboard actually) to write my own and the Orion the Hunter series was born. Little did I know that, at that moment, I was sowing the seeds of change. For, just a few months later, as a somewhat bewildered Amazon Kindle bestselling Indie author, I quit my career as an education professional to write full time. All of my releases (so far) have been kindle bestsellers - something that still astounds me. I'm about to release the first part of my Rouge Passion series - a two part series chronicling the story of Isla and Xander. It will be released on 30th June in time for my signing at the huge RARE signing in Edinburgh ... I may do some fangirling as well as signing ... the line up is awesome! I'm also signing at the British Book Affair in London in April 2015. I adore writing about feisty females and alpha males and whilst the content is definitely erotica, there has to be a strong romance element. I'm a lover of happy ever afters ... although I adore a good cliffhanger! I love to chat about books - mine and others' so look me up on social media - come and say hi. </p></div>","dc.identifier":"0fc93def-c09a-49bf-b197-ee04f7fea4d4","dc.publisher":"CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform","dcterms.created":"2014-06-13T04:00:00+05:00","description":"<div><p>Feisty redhead, Isla Hamilton is the ambitious Assistant General Manager of a luxury Kensington hotel.
