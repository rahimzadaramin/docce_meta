Her latest is a guidebook for pilgrims on the journey to wholehearted living, which she defines as containing courage, compassion, deliberate boundaries, and connection. She has defined 10 guideposts for personal introspection, which involve cultivating some positive quality, whether it be authenticity, self-compassion, or a resilient spirit, intuition, meaningful work, or laughter. Each guidepost is the focus of a chapter that contains illustrative stories, primarily from her own life; definitions, including the difference between shame and guilt; quotes from such diverse sources as Diane Ackerman and E.E. Cummings; and brief suggestions of activities that she pursues with the assumption that they might help her audience. Although these activities are highlighted in her introduction to the book, they are in short supply and the book functions more as a chatty meditation on the guideposts. Despite occasional moments of insight, this book's primary value may be in spurring thought and providing references to other authors that will provide further inspiration for those seeking a more meaningful life. (Oct.) </p><h3>From Booklist</h3><p>Human-behavior researcher and author of I Thought It Was Just Me (2007), Brown has made a career out of studying difficult emotions such as fear and shame. In this latest book, she emphasizes that above all other ingredients of living an emotionally healthy life is the importance of loving ourselves. In the grips of what she took to be a breakdown, or midlife crisis, Brown came to understand she was experiencing a “spiritual awakening” and worked to explore its significance and the interaction of knowing and understanding yourself and loving yourself. She intersperses her own personal journey with research and clinical observations of others of the work of living a “wholehearted” life, or “engaging in our lives from a place of worthiness.” The point is to embrace life and oneself with all the imperfections, releasing the stress of overdoing and overworking. Brown offers exercises for readers to plumb their own emotions and begin to develop the kind of resilience needed to stand up to unrealistic expectations of others and ourselves. --Vanessa Bush </p></div>","ibsn":"159285849X","subject":"Health; Fitness & Dieting; Psychology & Counseling; Self-Help; Creativity; Motivational; Personal Transformation; Self-Esteem; Spiritual","publisheddate":"2010-09-20 06:00:00+00:00","contributor":"calibre (1.8.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","source":"calibre:8246e3c2-fba8-4e1a-8069-994628f3706d","asin":"21181817-28d3-4092-bdd2-93884cc67c12","cdetype":"EBOK","updatedtitle":"The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You're Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are","fieldlist":{"asin":"21181817-28d3-4092-bdd2-93884cc67c12","author":"Brown, Brene","cdetype":"EBOK","contributor":"calibre (1.8.0) [http://calibre-ebook.com]","description":"<div><p><strong>#1 on The New York Times Best Seller Advice, How-To List!</strong>  </p><p>In <em>The Gifts of Imperfection</em>, Brené Brown, a leading expert on shame, authenticity, and belonging, shares ten guideposts on the power of Wholehearted living—a way of engaging with the world from a place of worthiness.  </p><p>\"This important book is about the lifelong journey from 'What will people think?' to 'I am enough.'
