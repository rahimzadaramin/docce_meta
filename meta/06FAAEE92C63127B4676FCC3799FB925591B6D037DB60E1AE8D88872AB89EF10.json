Furthermore, unlike in winter or life under severe desert conditions, nothing is static. Most of us live in a world where timing is everything. Here in Vermont and Maine where I live, there is about a week to prepare the soil, another to plant the peas, another to put in the tomato plants. There is a week where the bees pollinate the apple trees and a week for us to harvest the fruit, and another to dig the potatoes. All nature is on a tight schedule. The wood frogs mate in mid-April, the robins return late April, the blueberries bloom in May, and the geese migrate north the second week in October.

It was a joy to watch the frogs’ antics, and I tried to trick them to find out what they respond to, and to then contemplate and figure out their various stratagems.

For entertainment, he recommends, There is a solution that beats... a television set with 100 channels, by a mile: watching ants and other critters. The book features such mysteries as the significance of the mating habits of wood frogs and the eating patterns of caterpillars, but Heinrich also takes time to observe <em>Homo sapiens</em>, remarking that, like birds, we live in a perpetual summer, not by strenuous biannual migrations but by creating and retreating into 'climate bubbles,' reminding readers that they need clear vision and also a spiritual imperative so that we will focus on the ultimate ecology, not the proximate economy. <em>(Apr.)</em> <br />Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
