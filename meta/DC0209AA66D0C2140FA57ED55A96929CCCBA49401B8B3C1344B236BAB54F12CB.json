In a Southern Indian village, Asha doesn’t have much—raising two children in a tiny hut, she and her husband can barely keep a tin roof over their heads—but she wants a better education for her gifted son. Pressured by her family, Asha reluctantly checks into the Happy Mothers House: a baby farm where she can rent her only asset—her womb—to a childless couple overseas.

This title would make a great book club selection.” <strong>—*Library Journal</strong>*</p>\n<p>“<em>A House for Happy Mothers</em> explores the lengths people will go for family. The characters are nuanced and sympathetic, and the dueling perspectives of a surrogate and the biological mother are commendable.” <strong>—*RT Book Reviews</strong>*</p>\n<p>“A wonderful novel that takes you through the journey of surrogacy and the heart-wrenching emotions of those involved.” <strong>—Sejal Badani, author of *Trail of Broken Wings</strong>*</p>\n<p>“How far would you go to have a family, and how far would you go to save the family you already have? In <em>A House for Happy Mothers</em>, Amulya Malladi skillfully and compassionately raises these questions in a story of two women yearning to protect their families. This is a thought-provoking, modern-day family saga set against the backdrop of traditional Indian and American maternal expectations.”<strong>—Amy Sue Nathan, author of <em>The Good Neighbor</em> and *The Glass Wives</strong>*</p>\n<p>“Compelling and filled with insight. [Amulya] Malladi’s voice is layered, and her empathetic powers highly developed. Indian surrogacy is a crucially important and little-considered subject, and Malladi’s novel is thoughtful, enlightening, and moving.” <strong>—Leslee Udwin, BAFTA award-winning filmmaker of <em>East Is East</em> and *India’s Daughter</strong>*</p>\n<p>“A subtly nuanced and compassionate look at the controversial ‘rent a womb’ industry, Amulya Malladi's book is timely and illuminating.” <strong>—Nayana Currimbhoy, author of *Miss Timmins’ School for Girls</strong>*</p>\n<p>“<em>A House for Happy Mothers</em> shines an unblinking light on the business of surrogacy in India, and the emotional fallout. Can anything balance the inequality of power between a poor surrogate and a biological mother? A husband and wife in an arranged marriage? A mother and daughter struggling with years of perceived disappointment? Compelling and realistic, Amulya Malladi’s latest release is the perfect choice for book clubs, and any reader with a questioning mind and an open heart.” <strong>—Lorrie Thomson, author of <em>A Measure of Happiness</em> and *What’s Left Behind</strong>*</p>\n<p>“A sensitive exploration of the emotional terrain of motherhood and the socio-economic complexities of our global world. Amulya Malladi’s novel contains no villains or heroes, just breathing, living characters who will draw you into their heartbreak.”<strong>—Shilpi Somaya Gowda, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Secret Daughter</em> and *The Golden Son</strong>*</p>\n<p>“In this timely contemporary novel, Malladi describes the important and controversial issue of surrogate pregnancy with a light and masterful [hand]. Readers will find their hearts deeply touched by the longings of the two women who become inextricably intertwined in this process of giving and receiving the ultimate gift—the birth of a child.” —<strong>Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni, author of <em>The Palace of Illusions</em> and *Before We Visit the Goddess</strong>*</p>\n<h3>About the Author</h3>\n<p>Amulya Malladi is the author of six novels, including <em>The Sound of Language</em> and <em>The Mango Season</em>.
