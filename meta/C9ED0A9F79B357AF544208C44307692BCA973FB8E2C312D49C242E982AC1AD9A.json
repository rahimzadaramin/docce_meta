I lost several of my friends and fellow combatants. In fact, the Nigeria-Biafra war saw many families scattered with many lost, never to be seen again. While there have been several accounts of this terrible war which caused untold hardship to the Igbos, during and after the war, this book is a presentation of these facts from the side of someone who actually fought the war and lived to talk about it.Many have opined that the Biafra war was a result of the ambition of one man - Odimegwu Ojukwu; but nothing can be farther from the truth than this.
