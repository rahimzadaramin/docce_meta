Will keep readers turning the pages.” (<em>Library Journal</em>, starred review)  </p>\n<p>“<em>The Perfect Mother</em> is a gripping page turner that explores the pressures of modern motherhood, as well as a mother’s absolute worst nightmare. At once wonderfully nuanced and compulsively readable, it keeps you guessing at every moment up until the very end.
