After taking the B.Sc (Hons.) degree in physics from the Kerala University in 1958 with a first class and the first rank, he joined the Physical Research laboratory, Ahmedabad, where he worked for the Ph.D degree (awarded by the Gujarat University) till 1962. Between 1962 and early 1967 he did post-doctoral research successively at the University of California, Davis, the Indiana University, Bloomington, and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay. He joined the Faculty of the Kurukshetra University as Reader in Physics in March 1967. He shifted to the University of Calicut in June 1976.His contribution in the field of research includes works on the Core-excitation (Thankappan-True) Model of odd-mass nuclei, the Feynman postulates in quantum mechanics, faster-than-light particles and the EPR paradox.
